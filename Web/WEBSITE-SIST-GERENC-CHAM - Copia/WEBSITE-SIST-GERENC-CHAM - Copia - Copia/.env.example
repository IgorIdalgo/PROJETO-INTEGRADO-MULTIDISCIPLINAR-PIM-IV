### Configure the backend URL for development
# If you run the provided .NET backend locally, set this to its HTTPS URL
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:5001

# When VITE_API_URL is set, the frontend will try to call the backend endpoints
# (e.g., POST /api/auth/login, GET /api/chamados). If the backend is unreachable,
# the app will automatically fallback to the built-in mock data.
